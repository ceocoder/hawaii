* Half way to Hawaii Game

Passengers flying to Hawaii with United Airlines can participate in a contest on-board which involves guessing at what time the plane will be at halfway point between mainland US and Hawaii.  The pilot provides
- distance
- airspeed
- headwind
- start time (in HST).

* Observations

- majority of the distance is covered at cruising altitude at constant speed
- during ascent and descent speed increase/decrease is fairly linear, to obtain average speed during ascent/descent we can use slope of distance covered to acheive max speed and max speed.
- based on very scientific process of guesswork, slope we are using is 0.64

** Here are final parameters we are working with

- totalDistance
- ascentDistance = 100nm
- descentDistance = 100nm
- cruisingDistance = totalDistance - ascentDistance - descentDistance
- groundSpeed = airspeed - headwinds
- average ascent/descent speed = groundSpeed * slope (0.64)
- start time (in HST)

#+begin_src
  ascentDuration = ascentDistance in nm / ascentSpeed in nm/h
  descentDuration = descentDistance in nm / descentSpeed in nm/h
  cruiseDuration = cruisingDistance in nm / cruisingSpeed in nm/h

  totalDuration = (ascentDuration + descentDuration + cruiseDuration)
#+end_src

- assuming that ascentDuration â‰ˆ descentDuration

#+begin_src
  timeAtHalfWayPoint = startTime + totalDuration / 2
#+end_src

Enjoy the trip and let me know if you win that book, Mahalo!
